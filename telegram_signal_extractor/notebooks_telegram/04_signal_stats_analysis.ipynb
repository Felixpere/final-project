    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to evaluate the real effectiveness of trading signals shared through a Telegram group. The specific business objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assessing the actual performance of these signals when compared to real historical market prices (from Bybit).\n",
    "- Building a reliable and structured database of all historical signals for further analysis.\n",
    "- Determining whether signals consistently reach their Take Profit (TP) targets or get stopped out at a loss (SL).\n",
    "- Developing dashboards and visual tools to understand patterns, performance by cryptocurrency, and signal direction (Long vs Short).\n",
    "- Laying the groundwork for advanced analysis, including machine learning models or comparisons with other sources (e.g., WhatsApp groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics have been defined to support these objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total number of signals sent**  \n",
    "  A raw measure of the channel's activity and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentage of signals that hit TP1, TP3, or TP4**  \n",
    "  Primary metric for evaluating signal success (partial or full).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Success rate by direction (Long vs Short)**  \n",
    "  Helps determine whether the channel performs better in bullish or bearish conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average time to reach TP or SL**  \n",
    "  A timing metric useful for evaluating volatility and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Failure or no-result rate**  \n",
    "  Measures how often signals fail or cannot be evaluated, providing insight into potential risk or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Most successful cryptocurrencies**  \n",
    "  Identifies the symbols with the best historical performance, guiding potential trading focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Symbol usage frequency**  \n",
    "  Detects repeated recommendations, possible bias, or overexposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duplicate or inconsistent signal alerts**  \n",
    "  Validates whether signals are being reused or inconsistently updated, which may suggest operational issues or manipulation.\n",

    "Key Insights: TP Hits by Signal Direction (Raw Count)\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher Volume of Long Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all TP levels, the number of signals that hit their take profit is consistently higher for Long signals than for Short ones. This reflects a greater overall volume or frequency of Long setups shared via the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "TP Hit Drop-off\n",
    "Both Long and Short signals exhibit a gradual decline in hits as the TP level increases from TP 40 to TP 100. This suggests that more ambitious targets are naturally harder to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability of Long Signal Performance\n",
    "The decrease in TP hits for Long signals is relatively smooth and consistent, indicating a stable pattern of target achievement across tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short Signals Underperform in Count\n",
    "Short signals consistently result in fewer hits compared to Long ones. While this might be partly due to lower volume, it could also imply less favorable market conditions for Shorts during the period analyzed.\n",

    "#### 1. Consistent performance across directions  \n",
    "Both Long and Short signals maintain similar percentages of TP hits across all levels. The difference between directions is minimal, usually within 1–2 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Short signals slightly outperform Longs  \n",
    "Short signals consistently show slightly higher success rates in percentage terms, indicating that although they occur less frequently, they tend to reach their targets more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. TP 40 and TP 60 show the highest success rates  \n",
    "Take Profit levels 40 and 60 show the highest hit percentages for both directions, making them the most achievable targets overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Gradual decline at higher TP levels  \n",
    "The hit rate decreases as the TP level increases. TP 100 has the lowest success rate, suggesting that more ambitious targets are harder to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Practical implication  \n",
    "Traders may benefit from setting more conservative profit targets (e.g., TP 40 or TP 60), particularly when following Short signals, which show slightly better performance in relative terms.\n"

    "This chart shows the overall percentage of trading signals that successfully reached each Take Profit (TP) level, regardless of whether the signal was Long or Short. It provides a high-level view of the effectiveness of TP targets across all signals.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **TP_40** was hit by **62.4%** of all signals.\n",
    "- **TP_60** was hit by **59.5%**.\n",
    "- **TP_80** dropped to **55.5%**.\n",
    "- **TP_100** was hit by only **52.6%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "- There is a clear inverse relationship between TP level and hit rate: the higher the TP target, the lower the success rate.\n",
    "- TP_40 has the highest global hit rate, making it potentially more suitable for conservative or short-term strategies.\n",
    "- TP_100 carries a higher risk, with a significantly lower success rate below 53%.\n",

    "This bar chart shows the number of trading signals issued at each hour of the day, using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as the reference. It helps identify when the signal provider is most active throughout the 24-hour cycle.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The highest signal activity occurs between **10:00 and 20:00 UTC**, peaking at **18:00 UTC** with **198 signals**.\n",
    "- A **clear upward trend** begins at **8:00 UTC**, followed by sustained high volume through the afternoon and early evening.\n",
    "- Signal activity drops significantly outside the 8:00–20:00 UTC window, especially during the early morning hours (1:00–6:00 UTC), which show very low counts.\n",
    "- This pattern suggests that signal generation aligns with **European and early US trading hours**, potentially overlapping with periods of high market liquidity and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications\n",
    "Understanding the time distribution of signals is useful for:\n",
    "- Setting up alert systems during peak hours.\n",
    "- Evaluating whether the timing of signals aligns with your preferred trading schedule.\n",
    "- Planning automation or manual execution windows to match signal issuance patterns.\n"

    "This chart displays the 20 trading pairs with the highest number of signals in the dataset. It helps identify which assets are most frequently targeted by the Telegram signal provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "- 1000RATSUSDT, MYROUSDT, and WIFUSDT are the top 3 symbols with 25, 24, and 23 signals respectively.\n",
    "- Most symbols in the top 20 received between 14 and 18 signals.\n",
    "- The list is dominated by newly launched or meme-like tokens, suggesting a focus on high-volatility opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "- The signal provider appears to target assets with high momentum or recent market interest.\n",
    "- High frequency does not necessarily mean higher success; further analysis is needed to assess win rates and profitability per symbol.\n",
    "- Traders following these signals should be aware of the associated risks of low-liquidity and highly volatile assets.\n"
